# fetching-data-from-apis
A workshop on fetching data from public APIs &amp; comparison to other scraping/fetching techniques

*Note: We recommend downloading and using the most recent version of [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) in this workshop. Firefox has some great tools for developers, including easy viewing of files in JSON formatting.*

## Resources

## Learning Goals

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
* Explain the concept of a public API and identify a few use-cases relative to your work/studies/personal curiositiy
* Use query strings with parameters in a URL to fetch subsets of data from an API
* View and parse JSON data, and recognize the difference between JSON and CSV data
* Identify the basic categories of APIs
* Identify at least one use-case for interfacing with an API using a programming language like Python (beyond the scope of this specific workshop, but helpful to recognize out in the wild)


## Outline

1. Why fetch data? (dogs!)
2. What is a Public API? (NY State Public API)
3. A glimpse under the hood: what is the request response cycle?
4. Types of APIs
5. Understanding the structure of data (parsing the JSON tree)
6. Future directions: accessing with Python, comparison to web scraping, etc.
